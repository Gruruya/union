## Example

```nim
import union

type None = object
  ## A type for not having any data

proc search[T, U](x: T, needle: U): auto =
  # We have to do this since we have to work on the instantiated type U
  result = None() as union(U | None)

  let idx = find(x, needle)
  if idx >= 0:
    result <- x[idx] # sugar for assigning without converting via `as`

assert [1, 2, 42, 20, 1000].search(10) of None
assert [1, 2, 42, 20, 1000].search(42) as int == 42
```
