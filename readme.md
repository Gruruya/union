## Example

```nim
import union

type None = object
  ## A type for not having any data

proc search[T, U](x: T, needle: U): auto =
  # We have to do this since we have to work on the instantiated type U
  result = None() as union(U | None)

  let idx = find(x, needle)
  if idx >= 0:
    result <- x[idx] # sugar for assignment without conversion

assert [1, 2, 42, 20, 1000].search(10) of None
assert [1, 2, 42, 20, 1000].search(42) as int == 42
# For `==`, no explicit conversion is necessary
assert [1, 2, 42, 20, 1000].search(42) == 42
# Types that are not active at the moment will simply be treated as not equal
assert [1, 2, 42, 20, 1000].search(1) != None()

proc `{}`[T](x: seq[T], idx: Natural): auto =
  ## An array accessor for seq[T] but doesn't raise if the index is not there
  # Using makeUnion, an expression may return more than one type
  makeUnion:
    if idx in 0 ..< x.len:
      x[idx]
    else:
      None()

assert @[1]{2} of None
assert @[42]{0} == 42
```
